# Objective
Despite a wide mention of the Covid-19 pandemic in recent years, there are many other diseases which are also risky. One of these diseases is obesity. Obesity established itself as one of the most dangerous diseases in the world. Data from Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser, two researchers from Our World in Data, shows that more than 5 million deaths were caused by obesity in 2019[1]. Obesity is also ranked as the fifth highest disease that leads to death.

Our team found that an increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat and sugars can be solved by using AI. Our team has talked to more than 10 university students, and we found that they have no idea on how much nutrient they consumed and they randomly choose a meal in their daily life. This is one of the strongest pain points that we want to solve to improve peopleâ€™ life and health.

Thus, we came up with an idea to develop a line chatbot that recommends and controls the user's daily consumed nutrition. We also enhance user experience by connecting to a restaurant to enable a contactless food ordering to decrease the waiting time and chances of infection of the Covid-19 in this pandemic era. For our first phase, we target to test our product within iCanteen with the engineering students. We hope that our product can prevent people from obesity.
